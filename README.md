CelebAMask-HQ was a large-scale high-resolution face semantic dataset with **30000** high-resolution face images and mask annotations.
CelebAMask-HQ was precisely hand-annotated with the size of **512 x 512** and **19 classes** including all facial components and accessories such as skin, nose, eyes, eyebrows, ears, mouth, lip, hair, hat, eyeglass, earring, necklace, neck, and cloth according to CelebA-HQ. 
For occlusion handling, if the facial component was partly occluded, we label the residual parts of the components.
On the other hand, we skip the annotations for those components that are totally occluded.

## Applications
CelebAMask-HQ can be used on several applications including: facial image manipulation, face parsing, face hallucination...
